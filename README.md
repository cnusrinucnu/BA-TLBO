# BA-TLBO
Utilizing the BA-TLBO (Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization with a Bagging Aproach) approach to improve disease diagnosis, the proposed implementation is in Python, and the results are visualized through plots. However, the code, particularly with the PID dataset, exceeds 25 MB, making it challenging to load in Jupyter Notebook format. Consequently, I have uploaded the code in .rar extension. The same methodology has been applied to other datasets, such as PID.
